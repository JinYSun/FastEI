1. Preparing the required information of compounds.
2. Predicting the compounds' EI-MS spectra using NEIMS.
3. Generating an SQLite library, including identifiers, SMILES, and predicted spectra.
4. Embedding the predicted spectra using the trained Word2vec model.
5. Adding the embeddings into an HNSW index.
